ðŸ”¥ 100 x CPUs in action: 

![](100xCPU.png)

All threads are in Running state, but they all are starving.

ðŸ”¥ Threads are starving when they can not run 100% of the time.

Here we see that CPU time is 2.9s = calculation time + some extra (probably context switching). However, it takes 23s to complete the task. CPU was doing other jobs for 88% of time.
